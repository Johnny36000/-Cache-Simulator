Developed a cache simulator that takes its input from a text file which contains memory locations. The code's main objective is to read the input and then ask the user to pick from direct mapping, full associative mapping, or set associative mapping. The program then provides the user with the cache output with all the necessary information, including the hit/miss ratio.
